1. Dependencies

$ pip install layered-yaml-attrdict-config
$ pip install datadiff

2. Working with a local git repository

At first, create a local git repo:

$ git init

Create a file 'test.yaml" and write some YAML data in it.

$ cp dvsdvr.yaml test.yaml
$ git add test.yaml
$ git commit

Then modify the YAML file and try this:

$ git diff

Make sure that the diff output matches what you have modified.

$ python ./yamldiff.py test.yaml

Make sure that the output shows CRUD operations correctly.
